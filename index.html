            Thank you for visiting my page. Building a website can take time. It requires 
            alot of coding using software such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The great thing about it is, its 
            done precisely to satisfy your web goals, and business goals. Good things take time to create and any good designer or developer is going
            to take their time so they deliver you something great that both them and you can be proud of.
         <br>
         <br>
            I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into beautiful interface
            designs. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant
            and efficient code.

            <img src="assets/about-pic.jpg" alt="about-pic" class="about-pic">
            <p>Passionate about building modern web apps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I know you may be wondering what a full stack developer does. Well, let me explain to you about what I love to do. I am proficient in both front-end and back-end web development. <i>Humm</i>, what does that actually mean? It means  that I handle the entire process of building and maintaining a website or web application. I am involved in all the stages of the development process, including design, development, testing, and deployment.
        <br>
        <br>
        I will recieve my Full Stack Developer certificate in September of 2025 from "NPower". Before attending NPower, I graduated with a A.A degree (Associate of Arts). I worked as a teacher for a year, and as a first-responder communication specialist dispatcher for 5 years. I honestly enjoyed both positions, but I wanted to learn a new skill and I did. As the world is evolving through the use of information technology I became more interested, and thats what lead me in the field of software development.
